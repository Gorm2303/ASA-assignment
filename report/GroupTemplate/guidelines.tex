 Clearly describe the context of the problem and why a practical solution is important to the industry. Indicate who has been impacted, for how long time, how new the problem is, and what the trigger of the problem is.
 

 1) Identify prior work. You are not expected to have performed a systematic literature review as you would for the research track. However, identify if you are applying your own or someone else’s previously published ideas. Cite this related work.

 2) Explain what you did and the results you have obtained. What were the environment and the problem that you have investigated? How did you develop and apply any solutions? What were the results, impact, and lessons learned? Provide concise descriptions and rationales for your choices.
 
 SJ: Can we elaborate in more details of the QAW steps (Remember we did not record)
 
 Manglende præcision på vores krav. Hvad skyldes dette. Udvælgelsen af projekt groúppen. Andre folk for at få mere uddybbende information.
 
 Hypo. Med de her folk får vi de rigtige svar - men nødvendigvis ikke svar på alt det vi vil have svar på.
 
 Scenarier må være relevante - manglende svar på de mere målbare ting. Manglende eksperter SA indenfor området. Domæne eksperter bør måske vide dette. Men det gør det ikke.

 3) Describe your findings with supporting data, and do not base your arguments on just your personal opinion or conjecture. Industry track papers may be based on topics for which there was originally no expectation of writing a paper and consequently no controlled data gathering. Use the data you have and collect inputs and opinions from those who were involved.

 4) Discuss what makes your contribution innovative. significant, and useful for industry. To explain what is new, compare your results with relevant alternatives. If the findings were negative, provide a thorough discussion of the potential causes of failure, and ideally a perspective on how to solve them.

 SJ: Apply a known technique in a novel domain to discover/analyze QA 
 SJ: What makes this different from other domains? - look at literature reviews ?
 SJ: Due to COVID new ways to evaluate had to be discovered
